Transforms an operator expression into an expression in terms of integrals and amplitudes.

COMPILATION
------------

tar -xvf quant2.tgz
cd quant2
make

Generates an executable "quant2"

MAKE COMMANDS:

1) make : compiles the program
2) make clean : removes all object files and executables
3) make veryclean : removes all object files, executables, *.pdf, *.aux, *.dvi, *.ps, *.log, *~
4) make equation : generates "equation.pdf" from "input"
5) make depend : analyze dependencies in src

EXECUTION
---------

To run the program:
"quant2 <input-file> [<output-file>]"

If an <output-file> was not given, the output will be written in <input-file>.tex

The output file can be transformed to PDF using latex:
"pdflatex equation.tex"
(NOTE: the output filename has to be "input.tex" or should be changed in file equation.tex)
The equation can of course also be copied to some external TEX file. The definitions can be found 
in definitions.tex)

COMMAND-LINE PARAMETERS

--help (-h) print this README
--verbose (-v) be chatty - print more 

OPTIONS
-------

Various options can be changed in a config file "params.reg" (including a definition of simple new commands (set="newcommand"))

INPUT FILE
----------

The input file has the Latex form.
The equation has to be surrounded by \begin(equation) (or \beq) and \end(equation) (or \eeq).
The comments can be done using %.

At this stage the following mathematical operators and latex commands will be recognized:
(, [, ), ], {, }, +, -, <number>, \frac{<number>}{<number>}, \half, < <bra> |, | <ket> >, \op <operator>, \mu_<integer>,
\dagger, \dg, \prm <parameter>, \sum_{<excitation>[,<excitation>[,...]]} 

Following latex commands will be ignored:
\left, \right, \lk, \rk, &, \\

All not recognized symbols will be ignored and a warning will be written.

OPERATORS:

1) Parts of Hamiltonian: \op H, \op F, \op W and \op X (1-electron perturbation)
2) Excitation operators: \op \tau_{<excitation>}, where <excitation> can be, e.g., \mu_1, \nu_3, etc
3) Cluster operators and intermediates: \op <name of operator>_<excitation class>^<addition to name and/or \dagger>, e.g., 
                                        \op T_2, \op U_3, \op S_4^{X}, \op Z^{bla}_1
   <name of operator> must not match name of a part of Hamiltonian (1)!
Deexcitation operators have to be marked with ^\dagger (or ^\dg), e.g., \op T_2^\dg, \op T_4^{X\dagger}

BRA/KET:

bra and ket can be  
1) Reference state: 0, \Phi_0 or HF (all have the same meaning)
2) Excited determinant:  <excitation> (like in excitation operators ), e.g., \mu_1, \nu_3, etc
3) Explicitly given excited determinant: \Phi^<set of indices>_<set of indices>, e.g. \Phi^{ab}_{ii_{1}}, \Phi_{abij}, etc

PARAMETERS:

1) Parameter with excitation indices:  \prm <name of parameter>_<excitation>^<addition to name>
    e.g., \prm \Lambda_{\mu_2}
  <excitation> should match one of <excitation>s in Excitation operators or Excited determinant
2) Number : \prm <name of parameter>^<addition to name>   , e.g., \prm \omega^X

SUM:

1) Sum over excitations: \sum_{<excitation>[,<excitation>[,...]]} 
    e.g., \sum_{\mu_2}
  <excitation> should match one of <excitation>s in Excitation operators or Excited determinant
  
CONNECTIONS

Connection (disconnection) of an expression can be shown using "_C" ("_D").
E.g., (\op T_2^\dg \op W \op T_2 \op T_1)_C means that the whole expression has to be connected.
(\op T_2^\dg \op W \op T_2 \op T_1)_D means that a part of the equation has to be disconnected.
The following equality apply:
(...) = (...)_C + (...)_D

If connection sign is written after ket (|...>_C), the expression inside of bra/ket have to be connected 
(as in usual Coupled Cluster).

EXAMPLE

Energy expression:
\beq
<0|\op W (\op T_2+\frac{1}{2}\op T_1 \op T_1) |0>
\eeq

LCCD amplitude equation:
\beq
<\mu_2|(\op F + \op W) (1+\op T_2) |0>_C
\eeq

MP2 Lagrangian:
\beq
<0|\op W \op T_2 |0> + \sum_{\mu_2} \prm \Lambda_{\mu_2} <\mu_2|\op W +\op F \op T_2 |0>_C
\eeq

OUTPUT FILE
-----------

Closed-shell expressions in spacial orbitals.
Occupied indices: ijklmno
Virtual indices: abcdefgh
General indices: pqrstuvwxyz

4-index integrals are written in chemical notation (without |): (aibj) => (ai|bj)
All indices of amplitudes are written as subscript: T_{aibj} - first two indices corresponds to electron 1, etc.
Amplitudes coming from deexcitation operators have opposite order of occupied and virtual indices, e.g.
T_{iajb}^{\dg} - again first two indices corresponds to electron 1, etc. 


PERMUTATIONS

\Perm(<from>,<to>)
Indices in the expression has to be permute, the first set of indices is "from", the second is "to", e.g.,
\Perm(ijk,jki)T_{aibjck} => T_{ajbkci}
